      <p>I've always been interested in running my own indie video game company in the future once I have developed both my business management and computer science skills. Experience at a video game company in either the business or software engineering side of the workspace will be very beneficial.</p><br>
      <p>My first video game is called Words & Jack which is coded using the C# programming language on Unity. It took nearly 7 months to create, making video games ain't easy. Here is a short video of how it is played:</p>

      <p>Aside from my tech side, I'm also interested in arts and media. I believe having a blend of both creative and technical skills is very beneficial as innovation in tech doesn't come without creativity.</p>
      <p>I won a drawing competition hosted by MP Mike Freer, which I had briefly mentioned on the home page.</p>
      <p>I also rehearsed and performed in a production of Macbeth in the Platform Theatre, University of the Arts, London from September to November 2015. I played the character of Macduff in front of hundreds of parents and visitors. <em>It was nervewracking to say the least.</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>I memorised key dialogue and stage directions before rehearsals and the ultimate performance, developing time management skills.</li>
        <li>I was able to perform under immense pressure to meet audience’s and teacher’s expectations.</li>

      <p>I was a captain for a badminton team which consisted of eight players from February to May 2017 during secondary school.</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>I improved my leadership, teamwork, and management skills. </li>
        <li>I organised matches to play against different schools.</li>
        <li>I wrote and delivered reports back to head of PE department to inform about the current state of the team.</li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>I played tennis very regularly since I was 9 years old. Other sports I've played includes football, basketball, table tennis and baseball.</p><br>
